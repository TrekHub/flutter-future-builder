# Flutter FutureBuilder Example üöÄ

Welcome to the Flutter FutureBuilder Example project! This repository demonstrates how to efficiently handle asynchronous operations using the `FutureBuilder` widget in Flutter. The `FutureBuilder` widget simplifies the process of working with Futures and updating your UI when data becomes available.

## Getting Started üöÄ

Follow these steps to get this Flutter project up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com:TrekHub/flutter-future-builder.git


## Usage üß©

The core concept behind `FutureBuilder` is to wrap a `Future` and provide a callback function (`builder`) that describes what to display based on the current connection state of the `Future`. Here's a simplified breakdown:

1. **Define a Future Function**: You start by defining a function that returns a `Future`. This function represents the asynchronous operation you want to perform.

2. **Wrap the Future**: In your Flutter UI, you wrap the Future function in a `FutureBuilder` widget and pass the `Future` function to the `future` property.

3. **Handle Connection States**: Inside the `builder` property of `FutureBuilder`, you access the `AsyncSnapshot` object, which provides information about the current state of the Future.

4. **Display Content**: Based on the connection state, you can display different UI elements. For example:
   - Display a loading indicator while waiting for data (ConnectionState.waiting).
   - Show the fetched data when it's available (ConnectionState.done).
   - Handle errors gracefully (ConnectionState.error).

### Example Code Snippet üìù

Here's a simplified example of using `FutureBuilder` in Flutter:

```dart
FutureBuilder<String>(
  future: fetchDataFromAPI(),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    switch (snapshot.connectionState) {
      case ConnectionState.none:
        return const Text('None');
      case ConnectionState.waiting:
        return const CircularProgressIndicator();
      case ConnectionState.active:
        return const Text('Active');
      case ConnectionState.done:
        return Text(
          'Data: ${snapshot.data}',
          style: TextStyle(
            fontSize: 18,
            fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
          ),
        );
    }
  },
)
